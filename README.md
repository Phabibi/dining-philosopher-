# dining-philosopher-
implement an interactive version of the Dining Philosophers problem using the Resource Hierarchy solution to avoid deadlock. Each philosopher is a thread that is waiting in the eating or thinking state before a user input targets them. Their change of the states is reflected in the entries of an array that is called states.
